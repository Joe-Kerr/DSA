# About this readme

Let's see where this is going :)

If anything, it is going to be learning excercise. Below is just a list of algorithms and structures suggested by ChatGPT and Google.

The actual src files are cherry picked in the sense of what looks most fun or challenging, or can actually improve other projects of mine elsewhere.

## Math

Here, I refer to algorithms like "distance between two vectors" up to hardcore math in a research paper. I will leave this open for now.
